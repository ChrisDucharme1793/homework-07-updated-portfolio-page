## Hello!

This is Chris Ducharme's Updated.

## Built With

* [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) - I used Bootstrap CSS framework to edit image positions
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - We used 1 font style from Google Fonts.
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - I used the icons for github and linkedin.
* [html5up](https://html5up.net/) - I used html5up framework from multiple styles that they have for my website. I like the ease of the framework as they offer easily templates but the syntax or editing and creating new cards and banners can be difficult if you are using multiple frameworks.

## Email Form Doesn't work because i'm not sure how to set it up yet
